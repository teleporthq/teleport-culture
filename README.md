# Explore our culture

In this repo, you can read more about the why/how/what of teleportHQ. In other words, you will find here information about our products and services, details about the engineering culture and our internal processes, useful information about the employee benefits and so on.

### Why?

We believe in transparency and openness and we wish to showcase our company culture in the open. We hope to inspire other companies to do the same so we can all learn from each other, in a similar way in which open source software helped us all advance our capabilities and our understanding of the world of software.

### What

If you are starting your first day with us, you should definitely check the [welcome page](/welcome.md). There's a lot of useful information there about new hires.

If you want to read more about the company culture and our mission, check the [company mission page](/our-mission.md).

If you want to speak our language, we encourage you to check the [vocabulary page](/vocabulary.md). While working together we noticed the importance of "speaking the same language" and using the same words when refering to a specific concept/product/service. Therefore, the vocabulary page was created to maintain a single source of truth for every concept.

If you are interested in our internal coding guidelines, make sure you check the [guidelines page](/coding-guidelines.md).
