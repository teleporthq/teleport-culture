Throughout your learning process, you will follow the internal **skills matrix** with your mentor to ensure that you are on the right track.

### Before You Start

Let's get you ready for developing modern web applications. Before you start, you should have a working setup so we can work together in the most efficient way. This includes:
* git (with or without a GUI on top)
* a code editor (eg: VSCode) with a prettier plugin
* node >=10.11 and npm >=6.10

### Intro

It's your first week, so we planned a couple of meetings and presentations for you, so that you start your career on the right foot. This week will be focused on assimilating some core ideas about working as a web developer, learning in general and how to wrap your head around modern web development.

### Web Fundamentals
