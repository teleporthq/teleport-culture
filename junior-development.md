## Junior Development Path

In this document, you will find all the steps and processes that you will go through as your junior career in teleportHQ begins. Don't forget that your mentor is here to assist you on your journey. Always be curious, do your own research, ask when needed and try to make the most out of your learning and development time. Throughout your learning process, you will follow the internal **skills matrix** with your mentor to ensure that you are on the right track.

### Before You Start

Let's get you ready for developing modern web applications. Before you start, you should have a working setup so we can work together in the most efficient way. This includes:
* git (with or without a GUI on top)
* a code editor (eg: VSCode) with a prettier plugin
* node >=10.11 and npm >=6.10

### Intro

It's your first week, so we planned a couple of meetings and presentations for you, so that you start your career on the right foot. This week will be focused on assimilating some core ideas about working as a web developer, learning in general and how to wrap your head around modern web development.

### Web Fundamentals

Next we will focus on understanding how the web works and on the various solutions for building client-server architectures on the web.

Learn about HTTP and HTTPS. Understand the following:
* [HTTP vs HTTPS](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/ssl/why-is-http-not-secure/)
* [Requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods)
* [Responses](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Status)
* [Methods](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/http/http_methods.htm)
* [Headers](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers)

If you want to take an in depth look of how the internet and the browsers work, follow the next articles:
* [How the internet works](https://web.stanford.edu/class/msande91si/www-spr04/readings/week1/InternetWhitepaper.htm)
* [How the internet works 2](https://www.explainthatstuff.com/internet.html)
* [How browsers work](https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/internals/howbrowserswork/)

Additional tools we recommend:

### Core Language

Before we get into frontend/backend, let's focus on the day-by-day programming language. In this case you will work with TypeScript so that you get familiar with the syntax. However, keep in mind that the concepts apply to JavaScript as well. TypeScript is just superset of JavaScript adding types and certain syntax elements, but not changing the way in which the language works.

Before you start, these are two great reads:
* https://medium.com/the-node-js-collection/modern-javascript-explained-for-dinosaurs-f695e9747b70
* https://overreacted.io/what-is-javascript-made-of/

You can also get yourself familiar with the concept of programming paradigms:
* [Impreative vs Declarative](https://tylermcginnis.com/imperative-vs-declarative-programming/)
* [Programming paradigms](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/what-exactly-is-a-programming-paradigm/)

You can start learning about types and then TypeScript:
* [Types in JavaScript](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/tree/2nd-ed/types-grammar)
* [TypeScript official docs](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/home.html)
