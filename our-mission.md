# Our Mission

We are a team of passionated designers, developers, and data-scientists who are on a mission to humanise technology.

We are convinced that the future of application development belongs to the tools that will succeed in creating a “mental exoskeleton” for creators and entrepreneurs. In this future, humans will be able to spend more time and energy in developing their ideas, while the implementation details will be executed by smart automated processes and artificial intelligence.

However, we're also well aware that with each technological breakthrough there are collateral effects that can alienate the user in unpredictable ways. This is why we are setting some guidelines about how we do it in order to mitigate this risk.

## Ethics
We're a company and we need to sell our services and products in order to sustain ourselves. However, we commit to do so only if - and as long as - this is bringing value to our users without harming them or others, directly or indirectly. We strive to be a self-introspecting company, one that understands the responsibility we have towards our customers.

In order to achieve this, we are promoting a culture of open communication and direct responsibility. We expect that every member of our team is able to raise the flag when something is off. We will make sure that whatever concerns there are, inside or outside the team, they will be listened to and answered.

## Privacy
As a SaaS platform we need to store the data of our users. We believe that data privacy is an essential right for any user and we treat our users' data privacy as if it was our own. We set many technical safeguards in order to protect the data but we also encourage everyone in the team and outside to be vigilant at all times and to report any event that could compromise this effort.

## Values
Our culture is based on empathy, transparency, and solidarity. Over time, these values helped us build a great team, beautiful friendships, and have consolidated the trust which helps us overcome any challenge.
